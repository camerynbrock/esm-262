```{r}

```{r}
speed <- c(30, (40*0.278), (80*0.278), (120*0.278)) # speeds on four highways; *0.278 to convert km/hr to m/s

### Plot power as a function of speed

```{r}
power_speed <- data.frame(speed, power_heavy, power_light) %>% 
  rename(heavy = power_heavy,
         light = power_light) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:3,
               names_to = "mass",
               values_to = "power")

ggplot(power_speed, aes(x = speed, y = power)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = mass)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("deepskyblue4", "deepskyblue3")) +
  labs(title = "Vehicle Power as a Function of Speed and Mass",
       x = "Speed (m/s)",
       y = "Power (Watts)",
       color = "Mass (kg)")
